## Explorer Architecture

The architecture of the explorer are shown as below. We utilize HTML and javascript to encode our front-end and PHP for the back-end. The framework is based on JQuery and Vue. JQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. Vue.js is an open-source Model–view–viewmodel JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. Combined the two, our web provides a well-made layout and useful interfaces to serve the users.

It is worth mentioning that we adopt Responsive web design (RWD) approach to our explorer, which makes our web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Content, design and performance are shown across all devices to ensure usability and satisfaction. The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities.

For example, figure 5 and figure 6 shown below represent the responsive designs for iPhone X and iPad Pro respectively. The information in different devices are presented well-adjustedly.
